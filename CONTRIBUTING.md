# Contribution Guidelines

So you want to help? First of all, thank you!
There are few rules that we have so anyone can participate while maintaining a good workflow, teamwork, and clean code.
These are likely to get modified or added stuff to it, check them regularly.

## Github

### Pull Requests

- Try one commit per implementation.
- Avoid spelling mistakes.
- A code that does not compile or crashes is a code that does not get merged.

## Code formatting and structure

### General

- Please, respect the current code architecture; if you think something should change feel free to let know.
- Personal initiative is good, but for the sake of working together in good condition, let other people know what you do or want to do before doing it.

### Naming Convention

- We will prefer using underscores for function and variable names such as my_function.
- A code with unclear function and variable names will be refused.

### Commands

- Every command must have a description.
- If there are arguments, the command should have a usage field.

### Documenting and Comments

- You need to document every function that is not a command using ''' blocks.
- Try to explain your code using comments as much as possible.
- A code that is not documented is a code that gets refused on review.

### Config and Data

- Configs go in the "config.json" file. (see config file for path).
- Any text destined to users has to go in the "strings.json" file. (see config file for path).
